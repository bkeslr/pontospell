Pontospell
==========

Ponto is a Python program and library for measuring degrees of partial correctness in spelling experiments.
It was developed in the [Reading and Language Lab] at [Washington University in St. Louis] primarily to support research in how children learn the fundamental principles of writing systems.
It focuses on finding and scoring the best interpretation of a spelling as an attempt to represent the phonemes of a word by means of the sound-to-spelling correspondences in an alphabetic orthography.

We are in the initial steps of uploading our software to GitHub.
In the interim, a core version of the Ponto software can be downloaded from http://spell.psychology.wustl.edu/, where it may also be accessed as a Web service.
